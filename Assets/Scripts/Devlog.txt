DEVLOG FOR Drift Miner Simulator
May 2024

* IDEAS
- Make a Drift miner simulator game that player moves slowly to build a driftmine and mine. Also cutting logs and making building material.


1/5		* Started Game Development
2/5		* Testing with Marshing Cubes		
3/5		* Visualization works
4/5		* Mesh is correctly reset now
		* UV wrapping now works for all directions
		* Right clicking takes a box of chunk away from the mesh -
		* Made Chunks work even when not placed at origo
		* Chunks are copyable
5/5		* Scaling of chunk work with boxremover, scaling issue fixed
		* All cunks are made non convex -
		* Fixed alignment distance issue between chunks
		* Chunks now integrate and take affect from each other as a greater mass -
6/5		* Refactoring of code
		* Chunks starts to link together correctly -
7/5		* Chunks are now all affected by a caeve independently
		* All blocks that has pixels taken away update themself-
		* SandBox created, Non grid tiles counts as solid -		
		* Added Torch
		* Changed light settings
8/5		* Torches can be placed
		* Added normals to chunk meshes so light interacts correctly with them
		* Added Noise to light on torches to resemble flickering -
		* Added skybox-
10/5	* Added baseclass Carryable
		* Added interfaces
		* Added chainsaw, can be picked up and dropped like logs -
		* Added smaller Logs, player can cut up logs into 3 smaller ones
		* Added Posts and Lagging that are further cuts from the SmallLogs -
11/5	* Added placements of the Posts so they can connect
12/5	* Added placement positions inside ech placement so posts can be rotated
		* Added DOT calculation to determine which direction to place the posts 
		* Added base for player so he can stand on stuff without slipping off -
13/5	* Changed the Posts to only have a single attach point, making it simplier
		* Added ghost placement for post
		* Implemented the new posts placement
		* Added Laggings and placements for them -
14/5	* Added possability to place laggings on sides, they face away from player -
		* Gathered the ghost method and place method in same
		* Laggings and Posts cant be placed on themself-
15/5	* Raised grid above groundlevel, added start 2 blocks starting as mined-
		* Shovel can now place soil, but palcement bugged-
23/5	* Fixed placing dirt over chunks bug
		* Fixed placing dirt on 0 grid positions bug
		* Fixed placing dirt on grid size limits bug

23/8	* Made carryables stack due to itemData scriptable object
		* Carryables are lowered when one is dropped
		* Also Laggings can be picked.

1/9		* Placed posts can be dismanteled, should only work with loose ones
		* Posts are unshifted, laggings shifts correctly and correct rotations

		* Still got issues with aligning

		* Started refactor of PickUp - still need to fix stuff, Cut of for ghowst and first click

		* Change so any carriable can be picked up remove specific check somehow
		* Fix up chunk code, wery long atm
		* Make laggings align correct when carried, they stand up now
		* Make the shovel able to stick in ground?

		* Make shovel even out ground

		* Light flickers if to many lights or to close lights, disable lights when to far from player?
		* some light get through meshes down to bottom of chunk and shows borders of vertices

		// VISION

		* Make forest that regrows and can be harvested for logs
		* Make player able to dig chunks/stones from the underground
		* Make player able to add logging into the driftmine

		Step 1 - make the logging placements align to grid and placable
				 make logging have structural integrity so it holds up dig
				 if roof collapses it fills the corridor and needs to be re-mined
				 have indicator for how robust the roof is
				 have a percent chance of the roof collapsing
				 if roof collapses on top of player, he loses some progress gold etc to incite him not to dig in unsafe tunnels/keep tunnels logged
		? If adjecent chunk does not have support or its top is free, player can't dig without collapse?

		Step 2 - Have town where player can purchase tools to dig with and upgrade tools and sell findings






		* Make linked chunks update more efficient
		* Make player not rotate when bumbing into walls

		// TODO //
		* Walking Sound is off change to better grass walking and way of making steps
		
		* Should player be firsty person or able to change?

		
		 - MAIN MENU
		* Fix a menu

		 - MECHANICS
		* Player jumps to high?
		* Figure out what dground to use to be able to break it and mine into it

		* BUGS, CRASHES, SLOW PERFORMANCE
		* MISLEADING MARKETING
		* NOT ENGAGING WITH COMMUNITY
		* CONFIGURABLE CONTROLS,
